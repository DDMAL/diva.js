# diva.js website
New project site for diva.js. Work in progress.

For local development, install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and in the root directory of this branch run
```
jekyll serve -w --baseurl /
```

TODO:
- [x] Get multiple Try It examples working
  - [ ] Create more demo configurations on Try It page
- [x] New (final) screenshots on front page
- [ ] Text ordering on front page on mobile
- [ ] Navigation / go-to-top links in footer
- [ ] Jumbotron text readability/extend to top?

##### Performance:
